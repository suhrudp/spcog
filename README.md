This repository contains a printable PDF of the SPCog cognitive screening assessment from the paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2025.108776

SPCog was developed to overcome literacy and educational barriers that might confound existing cognitive screening results by incorporating culturally sensitive and literacy-independent tasks. SPCog demonstrated an accuracy of 0.80 (95 % CI: 0.70–0.92), a sensitivity of 0.83 (95 % CI: 0.70–0.92), and a specificity of 0.77 (95 % CI: 0.68–0.90) in detecting MCI, outperforming MMSE, SLUMS, and MiniCog, and showing comparable performance to MoCA (p < 0.05).
